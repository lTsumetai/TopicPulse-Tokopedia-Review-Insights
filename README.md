<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="FTDS-040-HCK-Group001-logo (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd4af1df-5de1-464f-9322-50d245ea7b44" />

**NLP topic modeling on Indonesian Tokopedia product reviews.**
Understand not just *whether* a review is good or bad, but the *theme* behind it. 
what customers actually praise, and what they actually complain about.

> Hacktiv8 Data Science Bootcamp — Final Project (FTDS-040-HCK, Group 001)



## About
This Project turns raw tokopedia product reviews into structured, exploreable insight. rather than collections of plain positive/negative sentiment score, each review is matched to one of several data-driven **themes** or topics (e.g. *packaging*, *fast deliverey*, *unresponsive seller*, *item not as describe*) discovered through topic modelling. 

Built based on **[PRDECT-ID](https://github.com/crush7/PRDECT-ID)** dataset and with text normalization dataset **[Kamus Alay](https://github.com/nasalsabila/kamus-alay)** colloquial Indonesian Lexicon

## Features

- **Home** topic modelling project description
- **Methodology** Model pipeline alongside model selection, and how does the model predicts
- **Interactive EDA dashboard** filter by sentiment, product category, emotion, and data exploration. lists of features inside dashboard :
  - Praise vs. complaint theme breakdowns
  - Star rating distribution, overall and by category
  - Theme-to-emotion heatmaps
  - Price bracket vs. satisfaction analysis
  - Geographic breakdown of review volume and negative rate
  - A category "bubble chart" (volume vs. satisfaction) to spot high-sell/low-satisfaction     categories
  - A complaint priority matrix to flag what the business should fix first
  - Best/worst rated products and a raw review explorer
- **Theme Prediction** Model Inferencing. paste any Indonesian product review and get its predicted theme (praise or complaint)
- **Review submission** form for submitting a new review, wired to supabase database.

## Project Pipeline 
1. **Topic modeling** (`Topic Modeling - DS Role.ipynb`): Reviews are embedded with a multillingual sentence-transformer model and clustered with BERTopic to discover themes or topics seperately for positive and negative reviews.
2. **Artifact export**: the train topics, theme labes, and dashboard dataset are exported to `artifacts/` as csv files. to read and to analyze the trained results.
3. **Prediction at inference time**: 
4. **Dashboard**: `src/eda.py` reads the exported artifacts and renders the full analytics
   experience based on dashboard dataset csv on `artifacts/` with Plotly.

## Team
This project was built by a three-person team. covering the Data Engineer -> Data Scientist -> Data analyst Pipeline:
- **Data Engineer [Derida Falahian](https://github.com/Derida21)** — data ingestion & pipeline
- **Data Scientist [Daffa Hutapea](https://github.com/daphutapea)** — topic modeling (BERTopic/LDA/K-Means) and artifact export
- **Data Analyst [Fauzi Maulana](https://github.com/lTsumetai)** — EDA dashboard, prediction page, and review submission UI (this repo's Streamlit app)

## Reference
- [PRDECT-ID Dataset](https://github.com/crush7/PRDECT-ID) — Product Reviews Dataset for Emotions Classification Tasks (Indonesian)
- [Kamus Alay](https://github.com/nasalsabila/kamus-alay) — colloquial Indonesian lexicon for text normalization
